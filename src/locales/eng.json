  "intro": "I am a graduate in Computer Science, with a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree with a Cybersecurity curriculum.\n\n            During my three-year degree, I acquired a solid foundation in computer science through the study of procedural and object-oriented programming, data structures, telecommunication networks, algorithms, software engineering, databases, operating systems, web and mobile development.\n\n            With my Master's degree, I had the opportunity to study advanced topics such as cybersecurity, DApp development with Blockchain technologies, cryptography, security in IoT, secure programming, digital forensics, penetration testing and artificial intelligence applied to bioinformatics and biometrics.\n\n            I am a curious and motivated person, always ready to get involved. I love exploring new areas to improve my skills and discover new opportunities for personal and professional growth.",
